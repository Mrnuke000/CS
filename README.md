# Python turtle
this is apart of a project we did using python to code with a turtle package, this allows to create lines, shapes, filled shapes, and even text. This can be used to create full drawings of quite anything; However it is very ineficant and is very tedious.
This is the work that I did for turtle, and some of the projects I did, along with some of the drawnigs that I created using turtle with python.


# CS
A github REPO for my comuter science class. This will include MOST of the work that I do in/for my class

This will probably include most of the work that I do in class this can include anything from lessons, to projects, to just being bored and messing around.
I mostly use REPL IDE to write my code. and i'll post most of my projects here That i make from there. 
But this could also include work that I might do thats related to my class, homework, or even just using a teqnuiqe that I used/ Learned in my class.

# UNITS 
Im taking computer science foundation class, and it includes 5 units, the first one is computing systems, the second is algorithms, the third is networking, the 4th is data, and the 5th is phisical computing. 
Most of the projects and code will be written in python, but this can change as I move on in classes, or if I just change my prefrence.
